During the recent project in the domain of Machine Learning on the problem of crop selection for agriculture using python.
I explored the machine learning some algorithms and libraries to make a selection of best crop on the basis of soil fertility (Nitrogen, potassium , phosphorus) , Climatical condition or Season, crop type using big datasets.
In the future enhancement of project , I also think to add some more factors  like Geographical regions , field area so that the model will take decision more precisely.
